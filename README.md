# 📊 Job Listings Scraping Using Botright

## 🔍 Overview

Scraping job data from platforms like **Indeed** can be highly beneficial for job seekers, recruiters, and data analysts. But, scraping these platforms isn’t always straightforward. Captchas, IP bans, and anti-bot measures often make the process challenging.

In this project, we explore how to efficiently scrape **job listings** and **salary data** from **Indeed** using **Botright**, a Python library that helps overcome Captchas and IP bans, while automating the scraping process.

## ⚠️ Challenges

When scraping job listings, you may face:

- 🛑 **Captchas** blocking access after a few scrapes.
- 🚫 **IP bans** when too many requests are made from a single IP address.
- 🌐 **JavaScript-heavy content** that traditional scrapers struggle to access.

## 🤖 Why Use Botright?

**Botright** is a powerful tool that addresses these issues. It integrates seamlessly with **Playwright** to handle JavaScript-rendered content and uses **AI** to automatically solve Captchas, making web scraping smoother and more efficient. With **Botright**, you can:

- Automatically bypass Captchas.
- Rotate proxies to avoid IP bans.
- Mimic human-like browsing behavior to avoid detection.
